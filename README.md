# NC-News front-end

This project was completed in November 2019 for the front-end block of NorthCoders. It's [hosted on Netlify](https://clm-nc-news-fend.netlify.com).

The back-end is [hosted on Heroku](https://nc-news-bend.herokuapp.com/) and you can view the [original git repository too](https://github.com/christopherMills/backendNews).
